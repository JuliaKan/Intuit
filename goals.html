    <p>I consider myself to be a lifelong learner. I love to learn new things and challenge myself as often as possible. I have been going to school continuously for 25 years and now that I have completed my Master's Degree and additional credits I am looking for my next great adventure. I became interested in programming and web development recently after hearing about Burlington Code Academy in the Seven Days. I spent the past few weeks working on <a class="bodyLinks" href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codeacademy.com</a> to explore the field and see if I have a knack for the field. It has been an awesome time so far and while this website needs LOTS of work I am happy that I understand some of the basic structures and processes. </p>
