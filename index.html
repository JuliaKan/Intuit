      My name is Timothy Lynch and I was born and raised in Colchester VT. I currently live in Milton Vermont with my wife Christine and my dog Sawyer. Up until June of this year I was an educator at Milton High School. I am currently enrolled in the Burlington Code Academy and hope to one day work as a developer in Vermont.
