      Hi, my name is Timothy Lynch and I was born and raised in Colchester VT. I currently live in Milton Vermont with my wife Christine and my dog Sawyer. I am currently in my eighth year of teaching at Milton High School. Being a teacher has been an amazing experience but I am currently in the process of looking for my next adventure.

      I have always had an eye on coding and programming thanks in large part to my father. My father was a programmer that spent his entire career working for IDX (now GE Healthcare) on Shelburne Road.
