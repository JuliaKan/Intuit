    <h1>Educational Experience</h1>
    </br>
    <h3>High School</h3>
    </br>
    <p> I attended Colchester High School in Vermont from 2006-2010. At Colchester I was a member of the Math Team, Student Planning Team, Student Representative on the School Board, and filmed the Varsity Soccer team during my senior year. During my years at CHS I discovered a passion for helping others, problem solving, and mathematics.
